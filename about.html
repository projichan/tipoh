      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The mission of The Institute for the Pedagogy of Humanity (TIPOH) is to advance trauma-responsive, 
          humanistic education by centering the inherent dignity, safety, and personhood of all learners.
          
          The Institute transforms learning ecosystems through research, educator development, family support, 
          and community-based initiatives that honor the fundamental truth that learning begins with humanity.
        </p>
        
        <p>Grounded in Cabell County, West Virginia, and extending its impact nationally, the Institute equips educators, 
          institutions, and families with the knowledge, skills, and frameworks needed to create safe, resilient environments 
          where people can learn, heal, and thrive. 
</p>
  
  <p>Through interdisciplinary collaboration, public scholarship, ethical practice, 
          and a steadfast commitment to transparency and integrity, the Institute seeks to establish 
          trauma-responsive education as a cornerstone of a more compassionate and humane society.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          TIPOH envisions a future where 
          every individual is recognized for exactly what they are: 
          a human person. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Guided by the core beliefs that safety is the highest form of love, 
          that no act of kindness done in love is ever wasted, 
          and that in all things, we teach, the Institute imagines a learning ecosystem shaped by dignity, belonging, and human connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This vision grows from lived experience, rigorous research, and innovative practice. 
          It has been carried forward in university coursework, educator training, family advocacy, 
          and the ongoing development of trauma-responsive frameworks that uphold human dignity. 
        </p>
        
          <p>
          The Institute seeks national pathways for educators, families, and 
          institutions to access trauma-aware, humanistic practices that transform learning environments into places of safety and belonging.
          </p>
        
            <p>
          Over the next several years, the Institute anticipates building a multidisciplinary team, 
          expanding trauma-responsive curriculum integration in universities and schools, 
          strengthening family and community resilience initiatives, 
          and advancing national scholarship through research, publications, and public engagement. 
          Ultimately, the Institute aims to reshape systems so that children, families, and educators 
          can flourish in environments where love, safety, and dignity form the foundation of all learning.
