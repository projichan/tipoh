      <div class="card">
        <h2>Family & Community Initiatives</h2>
        <p>
         The Institute strengthens learning ecosystems by supporting families, 
          caregivers, and communities in navigating trauma, advocacy, and relational safety. 
          This work recognizes that children thrive when the adults 
          in their lives are equipped with stable, compassionate tools and when home–school partnerships are strong.

          <li>Caregiver coaching and support</li>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Public Scholarship & Systems Engagement</h2>
        <p>The Institute contributes to national dialogue, policy development, and systemic transformation in education. 
          Through public scholarship and systems engagement, the Institute disseminates trauma-responsive,

          embed relational safety as a foundational element of learning.</p>
